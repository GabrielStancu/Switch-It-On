# Switch-It-On
Brain teaser-like game, turn on all the buttons!

Initially all the buttons are off, and pressing some buttons will change the state of other buttons in the same time. Turn on all of them to pass the level. 

Made with Visual Studio, Windows Forms App, C#. My first .NET application.

Creation Date: 21.02.2018 

Edit: Not a very optimal project, should be refurbished at some point...
